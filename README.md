# AQI
To predict the AQI value based on the independent features.

The air quality index (AQI) is a number used to report the quality of the air on any given day. It basically tells you how clean the air is. It measures particles and chemicals in the air that affect people's health.

AQI value ranges from 0 to 500. The higher the AQI value, the greater the level of air pollution and the greater the health concern. 

For example, an AQI value of 50 or below represents good air quality, while an AQI value over 300 represents hazardous air quality.
